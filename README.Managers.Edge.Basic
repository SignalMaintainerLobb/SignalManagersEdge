Manager’s Edge Spreadsheet – README

Purpose
This spreadsheet helps managers track, forecast, and stress-test maintenance expenses over multiple years. It compares standard spend, call-based expenses, and wage inflation impacts to optimize testing schedules and resource allocation.

User Inputs
| Input Field                   | Description | 
| CALLS PER YEAR 		| Number of maintenance calls expected annually | 
| HOURS / CALL 			| Average hours spent per maintenance call | 
| YOUR LAST YEAR WAGE 		| Manager’s wage from the previous year | 
| WAGE INFLATION 		| Annual wage inflation rate (e.g., 0.04 for 4%) | 
| STRESS TEST CALLS AMOUNT 	| Hypothetical high-call volume for stress testing (must exceed actual calls) | 
| TEST FREQUENCY 		| Number of times each test type occurs per year (monthly, quarterly, yearly) | 
| HOURS NEEDED PER TEST 	| Estimated hours required for each test type | 



Outputs
| Output Field 			| Description | 
| YOUR STANDARD SPEND 		| Total cost of scheduled maintenance based on standard testing | 
| CALL SPEND 			| Total cost of reactive call-based maintenance | 
| EXPECTED SPEND 		| Projected annual maintenance spend including inflation | 
| STRESS TEST CALL COST 	| Cost of maintenance under stress test conditions | 
| STRESS TEST WAGE 		| Wage-adjusted cost under stress test scenarios | 
| TESTING COSTS PER YEAR 	| Breakdown of costs for monthly, quarterly, and yearly tests | 
| HOURS MANAGER CAN SPEND 	| Time available for cost-cutting or optimization efforts | 
| MANAGER’S EDGE INDEX 		| A calculated metric showing how effectively a manager is managing expenses | 



Notes
- The spreadsheet includes multi-year projections (up to 23 years) to help visualize long-term trends.
- Stress testing helps simulate worst-case scenarios and evaluate system resilience.
- Wage inflation and testing frequency directly impact total cost and time allocation.
