" It's unbelievable how much you don't know about the game you've played your whole life"

Crossings Are Baseball, not Football :



Crossings are a losing game. You’re up against nature, time, and decay —and it has deeper pockets than you do. You’ll get farmed out, gamed out, and eventually gutted. You need more money, but you won’t get it.

It looks fine on the surface. Eye candy. You show up, it looks clean.

Business as usual. But it’s not.

It’s all good body nonsense —like we’re selling jeans or staging a photo shoot.

That’s not rail maintenance. That’s personal marketing.



There is a problem in railroads now: people aren’t seeing what’s actually happening.

And because of that, they’re misjudging their crews and mismanaging their teams.

Railroad leadership thinks in wages. But they should be thinking in calls. In supervisor time. You don’t buy wages anymore — you buy tests.

And to buy tests, you need to buy calls.



They look at a crossing and see a million-dollar spend. I look at it and see a broken understanding of how tests even happen.

The math shows wages, equipment, calls — but  does it show the health of that spend?

Is that crossing math worth the 1 Million bucks they give it ?

No. They’re asking all the wrong questions.

This is where crossing investment fails,

\- No calculation for supervisor response time

\- No model for call volatility

\- No year-over-year spend tracking

\- No alignment with long-term goals



That Battery Test Is Your Batter now :



This thesis puts the 1-month battery test at the center. That’s your batter. That’s your home run swing. But it’s not just about the test—it’s about the whole orbit of tests that spin around it.

More than half of the test investments at a crossing involve a battery.

And many other tests including trouble calls link directly to it.

on and on...



This framework treats the technician and their tests

—not as an optionally adjustable labor force, but as part of the crossing technology investment choice.

The Manager’s Edge ( or amount of spend Manager's fight ):



The lever here is the manager’s edge. We want to build all the intelligence we can around it. And we want to boil it down to one number: hours.

The battery test is one of the most valuable tests in all of rail.

But its defect is this: Its is an illusion who does the test determines whether the crossing is a gain or a loss over the 25 year period.

The PSR Manager Edge model aims to prove:

\- Wage gains don’t matter much when testing is locked into a 25-year schedule

\- Calls and testing aren’t adjustable

Instead, it models how supervisors ramp up time based on call frequency and rolling test spend year to year.

It attempts to force managers into fail safe windows to allow well preforming crossing investments to work essentially without them.



There exists within baseball, stats that explain even a top tier manager of a ball club

paid millions of dollars per year, has only at max, the ability to change the outcome of a few games per season; or

once a baseball team is winning, it operates essentially without them.



Output: Manager’s Edge in Hours

This gives you the ideal number of hours a manager should spend at each crossing. Just like a ball club manager, they’ll use those hours to:

\- Cut costs by minimizing crew size

\- Decide what work can be done during regular hours instead of during a call

Any other investment? Consider it a loss in the manager’s edge formula.



Manager’s Edge is a range-based framework designed to guide supervisors toward ideal investment time windows.

By aligning 'technician-led planned investments' with those ranges,

supervisors are freed from reactive crossing calls and can shift their focus to higher-level duties—strategic oversight, team development, and system-wide improvements.



Manager's edge is also the STRESS manager index and it indicates how much in hours supervisor investment will eat into a working crossing model.



10 calls per year against a 100 call stress test call per year scenario,

may bring only a few hours a year for a manager too improve the model, similar to baseball teams.



Successful crossings have a start of at least 5 years, where supervisor investment fails at 40 - 80 hours per year.



But interestingly when we crank up call amount to 80 calls per year against a 100 call stress test call per year scenario,

the supervisor failure sinks in around 80 hours - 120 hours per year at a crossing.





Managers Edge is also a rolling wage calculator that compares user input wage inflation against a running 2% , over 25 years.

So you can see your effect of standard testing spend on your wage inflation input;  against 2% wage inflation ;  in a running period.

Basically :



Managers Edge = ( ideal supervisor time in hours - real calls in hours + expected worst case for crossing calls in hours ) / rolling supervisor call frequency



or actually,



E\_m = \\frac{{Ideal Time} - {Lost Time} + {Saved Time}} / {{Total Time}}

E\_m = \\frac{T\_i - (C\_0 - \\alpha T\_t)}{T\_s}



simplified,



E\_m = \\frac{T\_i - R}{T\_s}

"Few managers can go into the operation of a crossing and be confident about what it will do over 25 years.

So you can hire them to be successful over that period.

But they can't be successful until they can be confident.

But when they become confident they become successful.

Managers edge is confidence."
